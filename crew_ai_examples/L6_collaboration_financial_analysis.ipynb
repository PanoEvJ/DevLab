      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: With the latest analyst estimates and stock price targets from MarketWatch, I can now develop a comprehensive trading strategy for AAPL. This strategy will incorporate entry and exit points based on projected earnings, stock price forecasts, and historical performance. Additionally, risk management techniques will be suggested to mitigate potential financial exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Based on the comprehensive data obtained, here is the detailed trading strategy for AAPL:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Entry Points**:\n",
      "   - **Based on Earnings Projections**: Enter positions around earnings release dates if projections are positive, specifically if AAPL is expected to beat earnings estimates which can drive the stock price up. Next earnings date is on 07/24/2024 with an estimated EPS of 1.33.\n",
      "   - **Based on Analyst Upgrades**: Consider buying when there are new upgrades from major analysts, as seen on the recent upgrades by DA Davidson and Barclays.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exit Points**:\n",
      "   - **Price Target Achievement**: Set exit points at or near analyst high target prices, currently at $275.00, which allows for significant upside from the current price of $193.12.\n",
      "   - **Prevent Loss**: Set a stop-loss order at approximately 10% below the current trading price to minimize losses if the market turns unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk Management**:\n",
      "   - **Diversification**: Avoid over-concentration in AAPL by limiting the stock to a certain percentage of the total investment portfolio.\n",
      "   - **Options Strategies**: Use options such as protective puts to hedge against downside risk or covered calls to generate additional income on existing positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitoring and Adjustment**:\n",
      "   - Regularly review AAPL's quarterly performance and the overall market conditions. Adjust the trading strategy accordingly, especially after each earnings report and significant analyst revisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Expected Outcomes and Scenarios**:\n",
      "   - **Bullish Scenario**: If AAPL continues to exceed EPS estimates and receives positive analyst attention, expect a gradual price increase towards the high target. The strategy aims for a significant return on investment with managed risk exposure.\n",

It's the longest such slide for Apple since the dot-com bust of 2001.Some of Apple's troubles this year were due to a bad economic environment for phones and computers. Over the summer, total smartphone sales were the slowest in more than a decade.But Apple also dealt with some company-specific issues. Apple didn't release new iPad models in 2023, the first time that's happened in a calendar year since the product was launched in 2010. Without new models, Apple has less to promote, and older versions of the product don't see official price cuts that boost sales.Earlier this month, all current model iPads were shipping from Apple's website in a day, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. That's a sign of weak demand because with the hottest products, Apple doesn't have enough supply to ship that quickly.In fiscal 2023, which ended in September, Apple's iPad revenue dropped 3.4% to $28.3 billion. On a unit basis, iPad sales were even worse, falling 15%, according to a recent estimate from Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan. Apple doesn't report unit sales.To make matters worse, new Apple Watch models were removed from Apple stores in the U.S. days before Christmas over an intellectual property dispute. After a late December appeal, the devices have been returned to store shelves, but Morgan Stanley analysts estimate Apple lost about $135 million in sales per day during the brief ban.Even for Apple's new products, like Mac computers, consumers showed less interest in opening their wallets for devices with minor upgrades. Sales of Mac PCs and laptops fell nearly 27% to $10.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Unit sales declined 11%, according to Bank of America's estimate.Apple shares still managed to jump 49% for the year as of Thursday's close, topping the Nasdaq's 44% gain. However, investors were better off betting on any of the other most-valuable tech companies. Nvidia shares more than tripled this year, and Meta climbed almost 200%. Tesla's stock more than doubled, Amazon rose 83%, Alphabet jumped 59% and Microsoft gained 57%.In order to return to revenue growth and support its $3 trillion market cap, Apple needs some new products to hit and global demand for smartphones and laptops to recover.A big test will come early next year, when Apple's first mixed-reality headset — the $3,499 Vision Pro — hits the market.\"We believe success with the Vision Pro is less about 2024 and more about its longer-term potential,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note this month.Assuming Apple ships 400,000 headsets, Vision Pro revenue could be about $1.4 billion next year, according to an estimate from UBS analyst David Vogt. He called the sum \"relatively immaterial.\"Enthusiasm will be the key. The Vision Pro is Apple's first completely new device since it announced the Apple Watch, and it will be sold through Apple stores. The headset could generate foot traffic and buzz for Apple's existing products. And there's a chance that it catches on enough to show that Apple has the lead when it comes to the future of computing.Some problems are fixableLooking overseas, Apple would like to see an easing of tensions between the U.S. and China.In 2023, Apple made significant progress diversifying its centers of production away from mainland China and into countries like Vietnam and India. But its moves to expand its supply chain appear to have awakened an impulse in the Chinese government to classify Apple as a foreign company. The White House called reports that Chinese government agencies told their employees not to bring iPhones to work \"retaliation.\"The Chinese government has denied them. Yet analysts are starting to worry that Chinese demand for iPhones, especially in the current quarter, is flagging. The iPhone remains Apple's most important hardware product, accounting for about half of total company revenue.\"Heading into the holiday season, iPhone unit demand remains the key near-term debate amidst macro woes and concerns around potential share loss in China on the resurgence of Huawei,\" Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote in a note this month.Despite its struggles, Apple remains a juggernaut. The company recorded $383 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2023 and earned nearly $97 billion in net income. Because the smartphone and PC markets were in retreat, Apple gained market share in some countries, where rivals saw steeper declines. In February, Apple said it had 2 billion devices in use, a closely watched metric that investors see as a predictor of future sales from software and services.Apple is preparing new iPads for next year, which could boost demand, according to Bloomberg. The company has submitted a software update for its watches to the U.S. government that it hopes will clear up the intellectual property dispute that briefly banned sales. IPhones still have a speed advantage over Huawei's new devices, partially thanks to import restrictions on chips and chip equipment.In November, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company's December quarter — its biggest of the year — will be flat compared with last year. He warned that Macs, Wearables and iPads would see a sales drop.But according to analyst estimates, the total sales declines are in the rearview mirror, with mild growth expected in the first half of the year and acceleration after that.\"Overall, the downturn appears to be over, and we believe it is time to see mild growth,\" Bank of America analyst Simon Woo wrote in a report this month.WATCH: Apple's Vision Pro is not expected to be mainstream hitwatch nowVIDEO3:0503:05Apple's Vision Pro is not expected to be the mainstream hit, says WSJ's Joanna SternMoney MoversMore In Tech DriversHere's what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has to say about the Apple Vision Pro Ashley CapootMeta says it will identify more AI-generated images ahead of upcoming electionsHayden FieldApple's Vision Pro virtual reality headset launches in U.S.Alex KollerRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

      "Economic headwinds seem to be gathering for business in general and for the technology industry specifically. But there are many regulatory incentives that may spur innovation and growth in 2023 and beyond. To survive and thrive, technology companies should rededicate their efforts to improving supply operations, modernizing infrastructure, and leveraging growth opportunities.\n",

      "Building a strong competitive position for the future\n",
      "The technology industry has not just weathered the pandemic-driven disruptions of the past few years; it has flourished. The crisis thrust many organizations into the future, accelerating digital transformation and changing work models dramatically. But in 2023, the tech industry will likely continue to grapple with issues around supply chains, workforce, and innovation—now exacerbated by considerable macroeconomic and global uncertainties.\n",
      "While tech stocks outperformed during the pandemic pressures of 2020–21, the sector led considerable stock market declines in 2022. A major challenge now for tech companies is how to weather a potential economic slowdown by trimming costs, increasing efficiency, and growing revenues. At the same time, many are likely looking for ways to remain innovative and build a strong competitive position for the future.\n",
      "Some of the specific themes we see playing a critical role in 2023 and beyond include:\n",
      "Leading through macroeconomic uncertainty. Beleaguered by softening consumer spending, lower product demand, and falling market capitalizations, tech companies’ C-suites are feeling the urgency to increase margins and grow revenues. Beyond workforce adjustments, approaches may include making business processes more efficient, relying more heavily on intelligent automation, modernizing legacy architectures, and considering strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n",
      "Navigating global uncertainties. As technology companies confront heightened global challenges they should work to mitigate risks and build more resilient systems. Leaders should think strategically about their choices of partners, where they’re located, and where and how production takes place. \n",
      "Transforming other industries through technology. On a hunt for new revenue opportunities, the tech sector is extending its reach into other industries, using digital advancements to support innovation and transformation. Tech companies are also seeking to improve efficiency and spur innovation in other areas that are ripe for transformation, including real estate, manufacturing, and retail.\n",
      "Adapting to new regulations. Climate change and social impacts are having an increasing effect on the operations of tech companies. At the same time, governments and shareholders around the world are pushing companies to increase transparency around environmental footprints and tax payments. New and proposed regulations are expected to require updates to business management software tools, enabling companies to achieve real-time visibility and to grant authorities access to data.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeading through macroeconomic uncertainty\n",
      "Faced with ebbing product demand, decreasing consumer spending, and falling valuations, tech company C-suites may feel enormous pressure to reduce their costs and improve profitability. They’re responding in many ways: conducting strategic reviews of talent; modernizing their tech infrastructure; and looking for bargains in M&A. Tech leaders should consider a mix of approaches that could enable them to emerge from a downturn with the right tech, talent, and growth opportunities in place.\n",
      "After hiring aggressively to meet demand during boom years, leaders are now aiming to rightsize their workforces. But right-skilling continues to be just as critical: 58% of technology decision-makers Deloitte surveyed reported that recruiting talent is a major challenge, and 48% said the same about retaining personnel.\n",
      "Tech leaders are using other cost and efficiency levers, too, such as revisiting procurement decisions, using digital tools to optimize sourcing activities, reexamining operations from a tax perspective to identify potential savings, and transforming operating models.\n",
      "Tech leaders will likely be looking to increase revenue in 2023 through strategic mergers and acquisitions. Indeed, M&A activity flourished in the enterprise IT sector in 2022, with DevOps and cloud transactions leading the deals. Additionally, alliances and joint venture partnerships present alternate pathways to grow market and revenue footprint. At the same time, to enhance margins and become more agile in dealing with future uncertainties, tech leaders may consider divesting their noncore assets to become leaner and unlock value from their core businesses.\n",
      "Strategic questions to consider:\n",
      "What steps are we taking to evaluate and improve our tech company’s operating models and business processes? \n",
      "How can we foster greater productivity, despite potential resource constraints?\n",
      "How can our company accelerate research and development of innovations that create opportunities for new products, services, business models, and ultimately new revenues?\n",
      "How can we ensure that our workforce has the right mix of skills for competitive success?\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNavigating global uncertainties\n",
      "Beyond the concerns around macroeconomic conditions, the technology industry faces global challenges ranging from geopolitical tensions to supply chain uncertainties, ongoing semiconductor concerns, raw material shortages, and enactment of new legislation and trade restrictions. In 2023, all these issues will likely top the priority lists of many prominent tech companies as they reassess partnerships, suppliers, and the markets in which they do business.\n",
      "With nearly 80% of digital components manufactured in Asia, the reliability and swift supply of parts and components pose a huge risk for US tech companies in the current market environment. In light of the supply chain threat posed by China’s COVID crisis and an ongoing trade war, tech leaders should consider exploring additional countries for manufacturing and sourcing of their products. While it may not be possible to shift product sourcing entirely away from China, the manufacturers that command a lion’s share of the technology market are likely to explore other Southeast Asian countries and perhaps nearshoring for sourcing components and assembling their products.  \n",
      "Global economic instability is likely to compound the challenges facing tech companies. Owing to conflicts such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and geopolitical tensions in Asia, tech companies may witness product shortages and delays, service disruptions, bankruptcy of core suppliers, increased product costs, and reduced global sales in the months ahead. Additionally, tech companies that have prior purchase commitments with their suppliers will be constrained to buy components at higher prices than those available in the current market, which will affect gross margins. In 2023, tech companies should consider revising supplier agreements to reflect new circumstances.\n",
      "Strategic questions to consider:\n",
      "How will our tech company manage our existing deals with Chinese companies, considering the push for onshoring supported by the CHIPS Act?\n",
      "How can we reduce our reliance on Asian manufacturers and diversify the component suppliers for our products?\n",
      "With ongoing geopolitical tensions, how will our company manage risks associated with technology and business continuity?\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTransforming other industries through technology\n",
      "Seeking new growth areas in the face of macroeconomic pressures, tech giants are accelerating their ventures into other industries. Health care is a prime example of this convergence: Tech companies are bringing improved efficiencies and innovation to a system that’s ripe for digital transformation. The global digital health market—estimated at US$211 billion in 2022 and projected to reach US$1.5 trillion by 2030—represents a huge potential opportunity for tech giants to continue their growth.\n",
      "But the health care industry is hardly alone in seeing transformations driven by tech. In automotive, some cars are becoming large mobile computers, equipped with sensors and software that can control almost every function, from assisted driving to safety and infotainment. Tech companies are supplying maps and voice assistant technologies to car makers. Some large tech companies are working on autonomous driving technologies—and may even have ambitions to produce their own branded vehicles and to offer self-driving rideshare services.\n",
      "In real estate, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and smart devices are being installed in homes, offices, and warehouses; analytics on the resulting data flows can lead to energy use optimization and smarter inventory management. In manufacturing, deploying smart factory solutions that combine a variety of capabilities has been shown to improve cost, throughput, quality, safety, and revenues. And in retail, augmented reality and 3D technologies are providing consumers with immersive digital experiences when they shop—whether in-store, online, or on-the-go.\n",
      "Strategic questions to consider:\n",
      "How might our tech innovations improve efficiency; enable new products, services, and business models; or revolutionize experiences in other industries? How can we ensure adoption at scale?\n",
      "Which methods—for example, partnerships or strategic acquisitions—could be most effective to bring our technology capabilities to other industries?\n",
      "What steps can our company take to comply with stringent regulatory requirements of other industries, which may include data privacy, security, and transparency of data handling?\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdapting to new regulations\n",
      "Innovative technologies and new business models tend to evolve more quickly than tax regulations can be written. The push into cloud and as-a-service subscription models, along with the increasing popularity of virtual assets, has blurred the lines between tangible goods, services, and usage rights. Different jurisdictions define and tax goods and services in different ways. Add globalization into the equation and it’s not always simple for companies to ascertain what’s being sold, where, and to whom.\n",
      "All of these complexities are emerging even as company shareholders and governments around the world are pushing for transparency—especially from tech companies. They want to know where companies are doing business; how locations and ecosystems are impacted; how much these companies are contributing in terms of taxes, employment, and commerce; and whether they’re paying a “fair share.”\n",
      "Tracking environmental and social impacts is another element for tech companies to focus on in the coming year. While consensus has yet to be reached on standards and metrics, reputable ERP vendors and industry groups have frameworks that may satisfy anticipated requirements. Compliance with evolving regulations may feel like a moving target, but companies may achieve success working by analogy (likening a new business practice or transaction type to an existing guideline) and documenting practices meticulously.\n",
      "Strategic questions to consider:\n",
      "How can we ensure we have a clear view of operations across the enterprise and the value chain?\n",
      "What reports and outputs will we need to achieve compliance with new and evolving regulations?\n",
      "To what extent is our tech company responsible for monitoring business practices and impacts across partners, suppliers, and service providers?\n",
      "How can we leverage transparency reporting to highlight our company’s dedication to social good?\n",
      "Did you find this useful?\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "No\n",

      "Final Answer: The assessment of AAPL's current risk management strategies in light of the information from the Deloitte 2023 Technology Industry Outlook indicates that while there are robust measures in place such as diversification, options strategies, and stop-loss orders, there are additional aspects that could be improved considering the economic uncertainties and specific challenges faced by the tech sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the economic downturn and consumer spending reduction highlight the need for tech companies, including Apple, to reassess their operational efficiency and possibly increase their margins through strategic cost management. AAPL could benefit from a more aggressive review of its operational expenses and procurement strategies to buffer against these economic headwinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, given the ongoing global challenges such as geopolitical tensions and supply chain vulnerabilities, AAPL should consider further diversifying its supply chain and possibly reshoring some aspects of its production. This not only mitigates risks but could also comply with increasing demands for transparency in production processes and reduce potential disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, in light of the regulatory changes and the need for increased transparency, AAPL should continue to innovate in compliance management, ensuring that all new regulations are met without hampering their operational agility. Investing in technology that enhances real-time data access and reporting could be advantageous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, considering the potential for increased market volatility, AAPL might want to explore more sophisticated financial instruments or insurance products that could offer additional layers of protection against market downturns.\n",

      "Final Answer: Based on the comprehensive data obtained, here is the detailed trading strategy for AAPL:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Entry Points**:\n",
      "   - **Based on Earnings Projections**: Enter positions around earnings release dates if projections are positive, specifically if AAPL is expected to beat earnings estimates which can drive the stock price up. Next earnings date is on 07/24/2024 with an estimated EPS of 1.33.\n",
      "   - **Based on Analyst Upgrades**: Consider buying when there are new upgrades from major analysts, as seen on the recent upgrades by DA Davidson and Barclays.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exit Points**:\n",
      "   - **Price Target Achievement**: Set exit points at or near analyst high target prices, currently at $275.00, which allows for significant upside from the current price of $193.12.\n",
      "   - **Prevent Loss**: Set a stop-loss order at approximately 10% below the current trading price to minimize losses if the market turns unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk Management**:\n",
      "   - **Diversification**: Avoid over-concentration in AAPL by limiting the stock to a certain percentage of the total investment portfolio.\n",
      "   - **Options Strategies**: Use options such as protective puts to hedge against downside risk or covered calls to generate additional income on existing positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitoring and Adjustment**:\n",
      "   - Regularly review AAPL's quarterly performance and the overall market conditions. Adjust the trading strategy accordingly, especially after each earnings report and significant analyst revisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Expected Outcomes and Scenarios**:\n",
      "   - **Bullish Scenario**: If AAPL continues to exceed EPS estimates and receives positive analyst attention, expect a gradual price increase towards the high target. The strategy aims for a significant return on investment with managed risk exposure.\n",
      "   - **Bearish Scenario**: If market conditions deteriorate or AAPL fails to meet earnings expectations, the stop-loss orders will minimize losses.\n",

As of the latest update, AAPL's stock price is at $207.15, which represents an increase of $14.03 or 7.26%. This is a substantial movement and should be considered in our day trading strategy. The stock has reached a new 52-week high of $207.15, which was previously at $164.07. The market cap now stands at $3.176 trillion. This rapid appreciation suggests strong market sentiment and possibly a reaction to recent developments or announcements.

      "Apple\n",
      "AAPL\n",
      " stock has fared well this year, rising by about 45% year-to-date despite a tough demand environment following the easing of Covid-19. While Apple’s Q4 FY’23 results published earlier this month were better than anticipated, revenue stood at $89.50 billion, marking a decline of about 1% versus last year. Earnings came in at $1.46 per share. Apple’s outlook for the crucial Holiday quarter was also weaker than expected, with the company expecting overall revenue to remain flat with the year-ago period, compared to the consensus estimates which predicted growth of roughly 5%. So what has been driving Apple stock higher in recent months?\n",
      "Apple’s computing products have seen the biggest hit of late as demand from the remote working and learning trend has eased following the pandemic, with PCs and tablets at large taking a hit. For perspective, Apple’s Mac revenue fell 34% to $7.6 billion in Q4, while iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, down 10%. However, it is likely that the PC market is bottoming out, with demand expected to pick up from the next year, with trends such as generative artificial intelligence expected to boost overall IT spending and demand for computers. Sales of the iPhone have proven a bit more resilient with revenue up 3%, given the traction that Apple is seeing in emerging markets such as India, Indonesia, and Turkey with financing plans and trade-in programs helping drive demand. Moreover, the launch of the iPhone 15 late in the last quarter could also help Apple to an extent. Although Apple has largely held on to prices across the line-up, a more favorable sales mix skewed towards the top-end iPhone Pro models could drive revenue growth. Investors are also likely pleased with the surprise turnaround in growth for Apple’s highly lucrative services segment. Services sales grew 16% to $22.3 billion in Q4, returning to double-digit growth, after growing by just 5% in Q2 and 8% in Q3 FY’23, led by the App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and AppleTV+. Apple says that it now has over 1 billion paid subscriptions on its platforms, with its total device installed base standing at over 2 billion. Apple’s gross margins are also surging to record highs. Over Q4, margins stood at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially. This growth has been driven by a favorable product mix - with Apple getting customers to opt for the pricier Pro version of its products - and also due to higher service sales. Products gross margin stood at 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, while Services gross margin stood at 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter.\n",
      "Overall, AAPL stock has seen extremely strong gains of 40% from levels of $130 in early January 2021 to around $185 now, vs. an increase of about 20% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in AAPL stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 35% in 2021, -26% in 2022, and 45% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 17% in 2023 - indicating that AAPL underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including MSFT, NVDA, and AVGO, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could AAPL face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\n",
      "Despite signs that Apple could see a turnaround in demand, we value Apple at about $178 per share, which is 4% below the market price. We think Apple’s valuation is a bit rich with the stock trading at about 28x 2024 earnings, which is elevated compared to historical levels. Moreover, revenue growth is also likely to remain in mid-single digit levels over the next two years, per consensus estimates. See our analysis of Apple Valuation for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Apple and how it compares with peers.\n",

      "AAPL\n",
      " stock has fared well this year, rising by about 45% year-to-date despite a tough demand environment following the easing of Covid-19. While Apple’s Q4 FY’23 results published earlier this month were better than anticipated, revenue stood at $89.50 billion, marking a decline of about 1% versus last year. Earnings came in at $1.46 per share. Apple’s outlook for the crucial Holiday quarter was also weaker than expected, with the company expecting overall revenue to remain flat with the year-ago period, compared to the consensus estimates which predicted growth of roughly 5%. So what has been driving Apple stock higher in recent months?\n",
      "Apple’s computing products have seen the biggest hit of late as demand from the remote working and learning trend has eased following the pandemic, with PCs and tablets at large taking a hit. For perspective, Apple’s Mac revenue fell 34% to $7.6 billion in Q4, while iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, down 10%. However, it is likely that the PC market is bottoming out, with demand expected to pick up from the next year, with trends such as generative artificial intelligence expected to boost overall IT spending and demand for computers. Sales of the iPhone have proven a bit more resilient with revenue up 3%, given the traction that Apple is seeing in emerging markets such as India, Indonesia, and Turkey with financing plans and trade-in programs helping drive demand. Moreover, the launch of the iPhone 15 late in the last quarter could also help Apple to an extent. Although Apple has largely held on to prices across the line-up, a more favorable sales mix skewed towards the top-end iPhone Pro models could drive revenue growth. Investors are also likely pleased with the surprise turnaround in growth for Apple’s highly lucrative services segment. Services sales grew 16% to $22.3 billion in Q4, returning to double-digit growth, after growing by just 5% in Q2 and 8% in Q3 FY’23, led by the App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and AppleTV+. Apple says that it now has over 1 billion paid subscriptions on its platforms, with its total device installed base standing at over 2 billion. Apple’s gross margins are also surging to record highs. Over Q4, margins stood at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially. This growth has been driven by a favorable product mix - with Apple getting customers to opt for the pricier Pro version of its products - and also due to higher service sales. Overall, AAPL stock has seen extremely strong gains of 40% from levels of $130 in early January 2021 to around $185 now, vs. an increase of about 20% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in AAPL stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 35% in 2021, -26% in 2022, and 45% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 17% in 2023 - indicating that AAPL underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including MSFT, NVDA, and AVGO, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could AAPL face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\n",
      "Despite signs that Apple could see a turnaround in demand, we value Apple at about $178 per share, which is 4% below the market price. We think Apple’s valuation is a bit rich with the stock trading at about 28x 2024 earnings, which is elevated compared to historical levels. Moreover, revenue growth is also likely to remain in mid-single digit levels over the next two years, per consensus estimates. See our analysis of Apple Valuation for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for Apple and how it compares with peers.\n",

Morgan Stanley said Apple's AI features strongly position the company with \"the most differentiated consumer digital agent.\" And the features will drive consumers to upgrade their iPhones, which should \"accelerate device replacement cycles.\" Musk drops OpenAI suitElon Musk dropped his lawsuit against OpenAI, CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, which alleged breach of contract and fiduciary duty. The lawsuit centered scheduled for a hearing in San Francisco, centered on Musk's claim that OpenAI deviated from its original non-profit mission to pursue profits under Microsoft's control. Legal experts had questioned the case's foundation, as the underlying contract was not a formal written agreement. GM trim EV salesGeneral Motors trimmed its electric vehicles sales and production forecast as demand softened for the industry as a whole. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the company now expects production of 200,000 to 250,000 EVs this year, down from a previously announced range of 200,000 to 300,000. The company's shares rose 1.3% after the automaker announced plans to buy back $6 billion of stock. OpenAI revoltOpenAI, valued at $80 billion, plans to allow stakeholders to sell a portion of their shares but current and former employees are concerned by what they see as restrictive practices, CNBC has learned. Many early employees hold millions in equity but face limited options for realizing value due to the high valuation of the AI company and no plans to IPO. OpenAI aims to conduct yearly tender offers but internal documents, communications and interviews with employees highlight growing unease over equity access, with the company also able to claw back vested equity.[PRO] Lingering skepticismApple's stock performance has been outpaced by other major tech companies this year, with some analysts attributing this lag to the company's lack of a publicly articulated AI strategy. While many analysts expect Apple's new AI offering to push consumers to buy new iPhones, not all analysts are convinced.\n",

      "The bottom lineThe Federal Reserve faces a fresh inflation headache as Goldman Sachs forecasts Brent crude oil prices could soar to $86 a barrel in the third quarter. The investment bank cites surging summer demand and a substantial supply deficit, which could drive up gasoline costs and further complicate the Fed's policy decisions during its upcoming meeting. While former World Bank President David Malpass criticized the Fed's past mistakes, he also took aim at the Biden administration's fiscal policies on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" saying, \"The Fed made a big mistake at being at zero for a long time. It takes years to straighten out that problem. Real interest rates are high enough, we need to recognize inflation is coming from what the rest of the  government is doing, in terms of regulation. We need to recognize that the government drained the SPR, Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the wrong time.\" Malpass was referring to the administration's release of 1 million barrels of gasoline from reserves ahead of the July 4 holiday.  He also highlighted the U.S. government's excessive spending, stating, \"The U.S. government is sucking up money from around the world to spend on things it wants... That causes businesses to invest less and we end up with slow growth out into the future and big deficits.\" Despite the upcoming release of consumer price inflation data before the bell, former Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart told \"Squawk Box\" that it's unlikely to significantly impact the outcome of the Fed's meeting. He said, \"In my experience when people are sort of locked into their positions. It would take a pretty startling CPI report to change the basic momentum of the meeting... On balance, this is going to be a boring meeting.\"Boring it may be but it is inescapable that Wall Street will be scrutinizing the Fed's decision and the guidance it offers to figure out when it could consider cutting rates. Right now, the CME's FedWatch Tool suggests that there is a 50/50 chance of a rate cut in September and a 66% chance in November. For more, CNBC's Jeff Cox explains there could be a huge impact from the consumer price index and the Fed meeting. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Lisa Kailai Han, Alex Harring, Spencer Kimball, Hayden Field, Samantha Subin, Ashley Capoot and Michael Wayland contributed to this report.More In Daily OpenCNBC Daily Open: Apple shares pop, Musk drops OpenAI lawsuitAbid Ali38 min agoCNBC Daily Open: Musk threatens Apple banAbid AliCNBC Daily Open: Apple upgrades Siri with AIAbid AliRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Based on the current market analysis and specific conditions affecting AAPL stock, here are the refined trading strategies for AAPL:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Adjust Entry and Exit Points**: Given AAPL's recent spike to record highs following announcements in artificial intelligence, it's prudent to revise entry points slightly above the current market price during pullbacks. This strategy capitalizes on the momentum and avoids buying at the peak. Exit points should be set at predetermined profit targets or prior resistance levels, adjusted for recent performance and market sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorporate Tighter Stop-Loss Orders**: With increased market volatility, particularly influenced by external factors like oil prices and interest rates, tighter stop-loss orders will help mitigate risk. Positioning stop losses just below recent lows or technical support levels can limit potential losses if the market retracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Leverage Short-term Technical Indicators**: Utilize indicators like moving averages, RSI, and MACD to identify optimal short-term entry and exit points. Given AAPL's volatility and growth, these indicators can provide insights into momentum shifts and potential reversal points.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitor Economic Indicators**: Keep a close watch on developments related to interest rates and oil prices, as these have direct implications on market conditions and AAPL's stock performance. Adjust trading decisions based on economic forecasts and policy announcements, particularly from the Fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Capitalize on AI Developments**: With AAPL's push into AI and partnerships with major AI firms, there is potential for substantial medium to long-term growth. Strategies should include a component for holding a portion of AAPL shares to benefit from future gains tied to these technological advancements.\n",

      "   - **Increased Monitoring Frequency**: Monitor AAPL’s stock performance more frequently throughout the trading day to swiftly adjust to rapid market changes and external factors like oil prices and interest rates.\n",

It's the longest such slide for Apple since the dot-com bust of 2001.Some of Apple's troubles this year were due to a bad economic environment for phones and computers. Over the summer, total smartphone sales were the slowest in more than a decade.But Apple also dealt with some company-specific issues. Apple didn't release new iPad models in 2023, the first time that's happened in a calendar year since the product was launched in 2010. Without new models, Apple has less to promote, and older versions of the product don't see official price cuts that boost sales.Earlier this month, all current model iPads were shipping from Apple's website in a day, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. That's a sign of weak demand because with the hottest products, Apple doesn't have enough supply to ship that quickly.In fiscal 2023, which ended in September, Apple's iPad revenue dropped 3.4% to $28.3 billion. On a unit basis, iPad sales were even worse, falling 15%, according to a recent estimate from Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan. Apple doesn't report unit sales.To make matters worse, new Apple Watch models were removed from Apple stores in the U.S. days before Christmas over an intellectual property dispute. After a late December appeal, the devices have been returned to store shelves, but Morgan Stanley analysts estimate Apple lost about $135 million in sales per day during the brief ban.Even for Apple's new products, like Mac computers, consumers showed less interest in opening their wallets for devices with minor upgrades. Sales of Mac PCs and laptops fell nearly 27% to $10.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Unit sales declined 11%, according to Bank of America's estimate.Apple shares still managed to jump 49% for the year as of Thursday's close, topping the Nasdaq's 44% gain. However, investors were better off betting on any of the other most-valuable tech companies. Nvidia shares more than tripled this year, and Meta climbed almost 200%. Tesla's stock more than doubled, Amazon rose 83%, Alphabet jumped 59% and Microsoft gained 57%.In order to return to revenue growth and support its $3 trillion market cap, Apple needs some new products to hit and global demand for smartphones and laptops to recover.A big test will come early next year, when Apple's first mixed-reality headset — the $3,499 Vision Pro — hits the market.\"We believe success with the Vision Pro is less about 2024 and more about its longer-term potential,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note this month.Assuming Apple ships 400,000 headsets, Vision Pro revenue could be about $1.4 billion next year, according to an estimate from UBS analyst David Vogt. He called the sum \"relatively immaterial.\"Enthusiasm will be the key. The Vision Pro is Apple's first completely new device since it announced the Apple Watch, and it will be sold through Apple stores. The headset could generate foot traffic and buzz for Apple's existing products. And there's a chance that it catches on enough to show that Apple has the lead when it comes to the future of computing.Some problems are fixableLooking overseas, Apple would like to see an easing of tensions between the U.S. and China.In 2023, Apple made significant progress diversifying its centers of production away from mainland China and into countries like Vietnam and India. But its moves to expand its supply chain appear to have awakened an impulse in the Chinese government to classify Apple as a foreign company. The White House called reports that Chinese government agencies told their employees not to bring iPhones to work \"retaliation.\"The Chinese government has denied them. Yet analysts are starting to worry that Chinese demand for iPhones, especially in the current quarter, is flagging. The iPhone remains Apple's most important hardware product, accounting for about half of total company revenue.\"Heading into the holiday season, iPhone unit demand remains the key near-term debate amidst macro woes and concerns around potential share loss in China on the resurgence of Huawei,\" Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote in a note this month.Despite its struggles, Apple remains a juggernaut. The company recorded $383 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2023 and earned nearly $97 billion in net income. Because the smartphone and PC markets were in retreat, Apple gained market share in some countries, where rivals saw steeper declines. In February, Apple said it had 2 billion devices in use, a closely watched metric that investors see as a predictor of future sales from software and services.Apple is preparing new iPads for next year, which could boost demand, according to Bloomberg. The company has submitted a software update for its watches to the U.S. government that it hopes will clear up the intellectual property dispute that briefly banned sales. IPhones still have a speed advantage over Huawei's new devices, partially thanks to import restrictions on chips and chip equipment.In November, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company's December quarter — its biggest of the year — will be flat compared with last year. He warned that Macs, Wearables and iPads would see a sales drop.But according to analyst estimates, the total sales declines are in the rearview mirror, with mild growth expected in the first half of the year and acceleration after that.\"Overall, the downturn appears to be over, and we believe it is time to see mild growth,\" Bank of America analyst Simon Woo wrote in a report this month.WATCH: Apple's Vision Pro is not expected to be mainstream hitwatch nowVIDEO3:0503:05Apple's Vision Pro is not expected to be the mainstream hit, says WSJ's Joanna SternMoney MoversMore In Tech DriversHere's what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has to say about the Apple Vision Pro Ashley CapootMeta says it will identify more AI-generated images ahead of upcoming electionsHayden FieldApple's Vision Pro virtual reality headset launches in U.S.Alex KollerRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: The article from CNBC highlights that Apple experienced its longest revenue slide in 22 years during 2023, with four consecutive quarters of declining sales. This downturn was partly due to a challenging economic environment affecting smartphones and PCs, and also due to Apple-specific issues like not releasing new iPad models and the temporary removal of Apple Watch models from stores. Despite these challenges, Apple's stock still managed a significant rally. This information is crucial for understanding the risks associated with trading AAPL, especially in terms of market volatility and the potential impact of new product releases and economic conditions on AAPL’s stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The trading strategies and execution plans for AAPL need to consider several risk factors identified from the analysis of Apple's current market dynamics and recent performance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Revenue Decline and Market Volatility:** Apple has experienced a significant revenue decline throughout 2023, which is a critical risk factor. This decline affects investor sentiment and could lead to increased stock price volatility. While the stock price has rallied, the underlying economic challenges and company-specific issues such as the lack of new product launches could pose risks to sustained growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Economic Environment:** The broader economic environment has adversely impacted the tech sector, particularly the markets for smartphones and PCs. This could continue to affect Apple's hardware sales, which in turn could impact stock performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Product Launches and Intellectual Property Issues:** Delays in new product launches, like the iPads and issues with Apple Watch sales due to intellectual property disputes, have had direct negative impacts on revenue. These factors need to be monitored as they can affect stock performance and investor confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Strategic Risks from New Products:** The upcoming launch of the Apple Vision Pro headset represents both an opportunity and a risk. Its success or failure could significantly influence Apple's financial performance and stock price.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Geopolitical and Supply Chain Risks:** Apple's efforts to diversify its production away from China to regions like Vietnam and India are crucial amidst U.S.-China tensions. Any escalation in these tensions or issues in the supply chain diversification could impact product availability and costs, affecting overall profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these insights, the proposed trading strategies should incorporate robust risk management practices, including setting conservative entry and exit points and maintaining tight stop-loss orders to manage potential losses effectively. The use of options such as covered calls and protective puts can also provide additional risk mitigation. Monitoring market and company-specific developments closely will be crucial in adjusting trading strategies promptly in response to new information.\u001b[0m\n",

      "1. **Revenue Decline and Market Volatility:** Given AAPL's significant revenue decline and potential for increased stock price volatility:\n",

      "   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep a close watch on news related to product launches and intellectual property issues, adjusting stock positions based on potential impacts. Use protective puts to hedge against unforeseen declines related to these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Strategic Risks from New Products:** The launch of the Apple Vision Pro headset poses potential risks:\n",
      "   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Allocate a smaller portion of the portfolio to this speculative opportunity, balancing it with more stable investments. Monitor early sales and market reception to adjust the strategy accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Geopolitical and Supply Chain Risks:** Production diversification amidst U.S.-China tensions:\n",
      "   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Develop contingency plans for supply chain disruptions and closely monitor geopolitical developments. Consider options strategies that can capitalize on or hedge against significant news impacting these areas.\n",
